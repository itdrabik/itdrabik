# Kamil Drabik – QA Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Automation portfolio. I specialize in designing and implementing scalable test automation solutions across UI, API, and contract testing layers.  
My toolset includes Java, Selenium, REST Assured, TestNG, WireMock, Cucumber, Maven, and Allure – applied in real-world projects and recruitment scenarios.

This repository showcases four selected projects, each highlighting a different area of automated testing and software quality assurance.

## 🧠 Approach & Testing Philosophy

- Context-aware technology selection – no one-size-fits-all
- Emphasis on test clarity, code reusability, and scalability
- OOP principles applied in all layers of the framework
- Realistic test scenarios, including REST API validations and UI workflows
- Readable, maintainable, and production-ready code
